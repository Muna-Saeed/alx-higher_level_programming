# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project contains Python code that demonstrates the concept of classes and objects in Python, with a focus on more advanced topics.

## Contents

The project includes the following files:

1. `0-rectangle.py`: Defines an empty class `Rectangle`.
2. `1-rectangle.py`: Defines a class `Rectangle` with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, and implements getter and setter methods for these attributes.
3. `2-rectangle.py`: Extends the `Rectangle` class and adds methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
4. `3-rectangle.py`: Extends the `Rectangle` class and adds a string representation for the rectangle using the `__str__` method.
5. `4-rectangle.py`: Extends the `Rectangle` class and adds a `__repr__` method to return a string representation of the rectangle for `eval` usage.
6. `5-rectangle.py`: Extends the `Rectangle` class and adds a message to be printed when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Muna-Saeed/alx-higher_level_programming.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x08-python-more_classes`
3. Explore the different Python files mentioned above and review their code.

## Usage

Each Python file in the project can be executed independently to see the behavior of the implemented classes and methods. For example:

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
```

This will execute the code in `0-main.py` and demonstrate the usage of the `Rectangle` class.

## Testing

The project does not include separate test files. Instead, each Python file contains a main section with test cases that can be executed directly. Simply run the Python file to see the output of the test cases.
